# Architectures-from-Scratch

In this repository I implement Architectures, either from Papers or other sources (videos) from scratch. I will include both a pytorch version and a Numpy only version based on my mini-torch library which you can find here https://github.com/RamDwarakanath/mini-torch.

The Architectures so far include:
 - Transformer (Decoder-only)
 - Transformer (Encoder-Decoder) (in progress...)
 - RNN (in progress...)
 - CNN (in progress...)


I will also verify that I get the same results from the Numpy-only and Pytorch implementations.
