# Architectures-from-Scratch

In this repository I implement Architectures, either from Papers or other sources (videos) from scratch.

The Architectures so far include:
 - Transformer (Decoder-only)
 - Transformer (Encoder-Decoder) (in progress...)
 - Learning representations by back-propagating errors (Rumelhart et al., 1986)
 - RNN (in progress...)
 - CNN (in progress...)
